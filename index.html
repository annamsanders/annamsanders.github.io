			<h2>&#9784;About Me</h2>
				<p>Hello! My name is Michelle Sanders. I am originally from Mexico, La Paz, Baja California Sur. A little fun fact about me is that while growing up I got to learn both Enligsh and Spanish at once, thanks to that I am bilingual. Once I graduated high school, I moved to South Carolina to attend the Univeristy of South Carolina. I am currently a Junior, majoring in Biological Sciencies. As a student in STEM, I am very interested in science and have a large curiosity about the natural world. Outside of classes, I am involving myself in research to prepare for a future career. I am now working as a biology research assistant in a lab that focuses on butterflies!</p>
				<p id="p" class="hidden"> My hobbies include scuba diving, where I get to explore underwater environments. It offered me a unique opportunity to observe marine life, such as octopus, which are very intelligent creatures!, different geological formations, and even shipwrecks. I am also very interested in herpetology, which focuses on reptiles and amphibians. I find their behaviors interesting since some can be based on communication, territoriality, and courtship. I am specifically interested in snakes because they are pretty much found all over the world, except for Antartica! They also are incredibly important in ecosystems, since they can be both predators or prey.</p>

			<h2>&#9784;My Future Career Plans</h2>
				<p id="q" class="hidden">I am interested in becoming a biological reseacher. I will be pursing to earn either a master's or a Ph.D. degree. I want to work in find new knowledge and understanding of living organisms, such as reptiles, amphiabians, and cephalopods, and their interaction within their own environment. I want to be able to conduct different expirements, analyze data, and possibly collaborate with other researchers that have a similar interest as me and publish research papers and/or present findings at conferences. I think it would also be nice to have the opportunity to become a mentor to students who are also interested in research.</p>
				<p>As I mentioned before, my main interest will be in snakes. I'd like to study relationships between snakes and other speices in a natural environment, and other factors that may affect population dynamics, such as climate change or habitat loss. I would also like to involve myself in evolutionary research, where we get to see how we've gotten to see diveristy of snakes we see today and what drove them during their evolution. Overrall, I believe that the research on these reptiles will be useful for conservation efforts and will also help us form a better understand of the natural world that surrounds us.</p>
